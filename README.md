# citibike trip visualization

Citibike trip (9/1/2015 - 9/3/2015) visualization 

The [Citi Bike](http://www.citibikenyc.com/) system, operated by Motivate, features thousands of bikes at hundreds of stations across New York and Jersey City. Citi Bikes are available 24/7, 365 days a year. Station locations are based on population and transit needs, and were selected through a participatory public input process.
